# paths

`paths` is a command line tool for specifying the initial `$PATH` environment variable.
It is similar to `path_helper` except that it actually makes sense.
It is written in pure Bash and expects a valid Bash at `/bin/bash`.

## Installation and usage

Add the `paths` script to a location like `/usr/local/bin` or whatever. Edit `/etc/profile` or a similar file by removing any previous `$PATH` manipulation and instead exporting `$PATH` as the output from `paths`. It'll probably look something like `` export PATH=`/usr/bin/local/paths` ``.

## How it works

`paths` reads paths from `/etc/paths.d/*`, `/etc/paths` and `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/paths` and prints a valid `$PATH` variable.
Files are read in alphabetical order and `/etc/paths` is always read last.
Paths within the files are read by line order.
Lines starting with `#` are ignored.

## Example

```
${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/paths:
    /home/username/bin
/etc/paths:
    /usr/bin
    /bin
/etc/paths.d/10-go:
    /opt/go/bin
/etc/paths.d/20-homebrew:
    /opt/homebrew/bin
```

```
/opt/go/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
```
